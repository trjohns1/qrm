QGIS plugin that allows the user to manage M:N relationships among tables.

QGIS (www.qgis.org) is an open source geographic information system that supports the modeling of spatial and non-spatial data and the presentation of that data in maps. QGIS supports one-to-many relationships natively, but not many-to-many relationships. The QGIS Relationship Manager allows the creation and management of linking tables to support applications where complex relationships are a requirement.
